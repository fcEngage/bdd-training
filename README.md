# bdd-training

This repository is work-in-progress and, once completed, will provide example, documentations and tools that will allow to have a complete training regarding how to bring the BDD approach in the whole organization, from the PO requirements to the TDD development.

The main branch is (and will be) deliberately a basic and incomplete initial example.

The complete solution will be created in the time, following the various talks and workshops that will be done on this argument.
## Sessions

The sessions that has been completed are the following
