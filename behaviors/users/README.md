# Users behaviors

*Users behaviors* are intended to describe the acceptance criteria of the user needs in an «ubiquitous» language, comprehensible to all the software development involved people.

Fulfilling the BDD framework you will create small, dynamic, flexible and easy to understand acceptance criteria. In this way you could *fix* the «requirements» word meaning, we will define them `Agile Requirements`.

Such *high flexible acceptance criteria* will be used to design and develop the software.

Using the power of BDD tools (e.g. `Cucumber`), such acceptance criteria will result in:

- behavior driven design, that will automatically and naturally define an high flexible domain-driven design, based on the user requirements
- TDD approach, with auto-generated code, starting from the behaviors
- auto-generated documentation, in natural language, that could provide screenshots and data examples
- a behavior database, that if properly created, could result in high functionalities and code recyclability.
